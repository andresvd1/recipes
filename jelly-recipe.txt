Method: 
1.-Prepare a ring jelly mould by spaying lightly with canola spray.
2.-It's tasteless and will assist in the removal of jelly at completion.
3.-Follow directions to prepare the first jelly colour(purple) in a jug and fill approximately 1/7th of the mould. This doesn’t 4.-need to be science, an estimation is fine!
5.-Place a lid on your mould or cover with cling film and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours, or until firmly set.
6.-When the first layer is set, prepare the second jelly colour (pink).
7.-Pour another 1/7th of the mould over the purple jelly, cover and return to the refrigerator to set.
8.-Repeat this process for each colour, to achieve a ‘true rainbow’ pour the jelly in the colour order listed in the ingredients list.
9.-When the last layer (red) has set completely, remove the lid/cover and place the plate or platter you wish to serve the rainbow on top of the mould, face down.
10.-It is a good idea to ensure the plate or platter is approximately 20 per cent wider than the mould.
11.-Invert the mould holding plate or platter in place, so the mould sits on top of the plate.
12.-Remove the centre part of the mould. The jelly will flop onto your plate or platter.
13.-Cut a slice in the bottom centre portion of the jelly, then carefully extend from the cuts outward to form a rainbow shape.
14.-Slice and serve with your favourite fruit or icecream – a party hit!
